A customer visits a shop to buy a soft drink; he has two options:
Drink A cost is Rs.25 and the size of the bottle is 11.
Drink B cost is Rs.23 and its size of the bottle is 9.
Which drink should he choose to save money? Solve this problem using function deal ( ).
<?php
function deal() {
$costA = 25;
$sizeA = 11;
$valueA = $costA / $sizeA; // cost per ml
$costB = 23;
$sizeB = 9;
$valueB = $costB / $sizeB; // cost per ml
echo "Cost per ml for Drink A: Rs. " . round($valueA, 2) . "\n";
echo "Cost per ml for Drink B: Rs. " . round($valueB, 2) . "\n\n";
if ($valueA < $valueB) {
echo "Drink A is a better deal.\n";
} elseif ($valueA > $valueB) {
echo "Drink B is a better deal.\n";
} else {
echo "Both drinks offer the same value.\n";
}
}
deal();
?>
OUTPUT:
Cost per ml for Drink A: Rs. 2.27
Cost per ml for Drink B: Rs. 2.56
Drink A is a better deal.
