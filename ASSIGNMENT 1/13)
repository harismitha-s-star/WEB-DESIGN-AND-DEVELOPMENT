Write a program to check student grade based on marks:
Conditions:
If marks are 75% or more, the grade will be First Class.
If marks between 60% to 74%, grade will be second class.
If marks between 40% to 59%, grade will be third class.
If marks are less than 40%, students will be Fail.
<?php
$marks = 68;
if ($marks >= 75) {
$grade = "First Class";
} elseif ($marks >= 60 && $marks <= 74) {
$grade = "Second Class";
} elseif ($marks >= 40 && $marks <= 59) {
$grade = "Third Class";
} else {
$grade = "Fail";
}
echo "Marks: $marks%\n";
echo "Grade: $grade\n";
?>
OUTPUT:
Marks: 68%
Grade: Second Class
Consider the following snippet, comment your views.
$sub = substr(12345, 2, 2);
echo “sub is $sub”;
OUTPUT:
