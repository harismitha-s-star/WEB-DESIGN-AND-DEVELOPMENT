Record number handling in PHP with suitable examples.

ANSWER:
In practice, “record number handling” usually means working with arrays (or database records) by referring to their index (position). 
This is common when fetching rows from a database or iterating through arrays.

CODE:
<?php
// Example: student marks (each element = one record)
$marks = array(85, 92, 78, 90, 88);

// Access record number 2 (3rd element)
echo "Record 3 (index 2): " . $marks[2] . "<br>";

// Loop through all records with record numbers
foreach ($marks as $recordNo => $value) {
    echo "Record " . ($recordNo + 1) . ": $value <br>";
}
?>

OUTPUT:
Record 3 (index 2): 78
Record 1: 85 
Record 2: 92 
Record 3: 78 
Record 4: 90 
Record 5: 88
