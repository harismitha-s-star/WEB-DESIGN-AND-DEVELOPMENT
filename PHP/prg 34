Replace all occurrences of a specific word with another word in a string using regular expressions in
PHP.

CODE:
<?php
// Original string
$text = "PHP is powerful. I love PHP because PHP is flexible.";

// Replace all occurrences of "PHP" with "Python"
$result = preg_replace("/\bPHP\b/", "Python", $text);

echo $result;
?>

OUTPUT:
Python is powerful. I love Python because Python is flexible.
