How to register a variable in a PHP session? Give an example.

SOLUTION:
In PHP, you can register a variable in a session by storing it inside the $_SESSION superglobal array.
Sessions allow you to keep data across multiple pages for the same user.

Steps to register a session variable:
1. Start the session with session_start().
2. Assign a value to $_SESSION['variable_name'].
3. You can now access this variable across different PHP pages as long as the session is active.

CODE:
<?php
// Start the session
session_start();

// Registering a variable in session
$_SESSION['username'] = "Kanishka";
$_SESSION['role'] = "Admin";

// Display the session variable
echo "Welcome, " . $_SESSION['username'] . "!<br>";
echo "Your role is: " . $_SESSION['role'];
?>

OUTPUT:
Welcome, Kanishka!<br>Your role is: Admin
