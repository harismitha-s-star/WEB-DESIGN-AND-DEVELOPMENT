Write a program to check student grade based on marks:
Conditions:
If marks are 75% or more, the grade will be First Class.
If marks between 60% to 74%, grade will be second class.
If marks between 40% to 59%, grade will be third class.
If marks are less than 40%, students will be Fail.

CODE:
<?php
// Student's marks (change this value to test)
$marks = 68;

// Display the marks
echo "Marks: $marks% - Grade: ";

// Determine grade based on conditions
if ($marks >= 75) {
    echo "First Class";
} elseif ($marks >= 60 && $marks <= 74) {
    echo "Second Class";
} elseif ($marks >= 40 && $marks <= 59) {
    echo "Third Class";
} elseif ($marks >= 0 && $marks < 40) {
    echo "Fail";
} else {
    echo "Invalid Marks";
}
?>

OUTPUT:
Marks: 68% - Grade: Second Class
