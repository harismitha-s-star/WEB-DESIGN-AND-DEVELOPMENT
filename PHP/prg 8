A customer visits a shop to buy a soft drink; he has two options:
Drink A cost is Rs.25 and the size of the bottle is 11.
Drink B cost is Rs.23 and its size of the bottle is 9.
Which drink should he choose to save money? Solve this problem using function deal ( ).

ANSWER:
<?php
function deal() {
    // Define costs and sizes
    $costA = 25;
    $sizeA = 11;

    $costB = 23;
    $sizeB = 9;

    // Calculate cost per unit
    $valueA = $costA / $sizeA;
    $valueB = $costB / $sizeB;

    // Display cost per unit
    echo "Drink A: Rs.$costA for size $sizeA → Cost per unit: " . number_format($valueA, 2) . "<br>";
    echo "Drink B: Rs.$costB for size $sizeB → Cost per unit: " . number_format($valueB, 2) . "<br>";

    // Compare and decide
    if ($valueA < $valueB) {
        echo "Drink A is the better deal and saves money.";
    } elseif ($valueB < $valueA) {
        echo "Drink B is the better deal and saves money.";
    } else {
        echo "Both drinks offer the same value.";
    }
}

// Call the function
deal();
?>

OUTPUT:
Drink A: Rs.25 for size 11 → Cost per unit: 2.27
Drink B: Rs.23 for size 9 → Cost per unit: 2.56
Drink A is the better deal and saves money.v
