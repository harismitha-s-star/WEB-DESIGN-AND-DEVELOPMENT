A retail company wants to forecast future sales based on historical data. Develop a system that utilizes
numerical types, mathematical operators to analyze sales trends, calculate growth rates, and generate
sales forecasts using arrays in php.

SOLUTION :
a mini forecasting system in PHP using arrays, numerical types, and math operators.
Let me show you how we can implement it step by step.

CODE:
<?php
// Historical sales data (e.g., last 6 months)
$sales = [1200, 1350, 1500, 1650, 1800, 2000];

// Step 1: Calculate growth rates between months
$growthRates = [];
for ($i = 1; $i < count($sales); $i++) {
    $growth = ($sales[$i] - $sales[$i - 1]) / $sales[$i - 1]; // percentage growth
    $growthRates[] = $growth;
}

// Step 2: Find the average growth rate
$averageGrowth = array_sum($growthRates) / count($growthRates);

// Step 3: Forecast sales for next 3 months
$forecast = [];
$lastSale = end($sales); // last monthâ€™s sales
for ($i = 1; $i <= 3; $i++) {
    $lastSale = $lastSale * (1 + $averageGrowth); // apply growth rate
    $forecast[] = round($lastSale, 2);
}

// Step 4: Display results
echo "<h3>Sales Forecasting System</h3>";
echo "Historical Sales: " . implode(", ", $sales) . "<br>";

echo "Growth Rates (%): ";
foreach ($growthRates as $rate) {
    echo round($rate * 100, 2) . "%, ";
}
echo "<br>";

echo "Average Growth Rate: " . round($averageGrowth * 100, 2) . "%<br>";
echo "Forecasted Sales (next 3 months): " . implode(", ", $forecast);
?>

OUTPUT:
Sales Forecasting System
Historical Sales: 1200, 1350, 1500, 1650, 1800, 2000
Growth Rates (%): 12.5%, 11.11%, 10%, 9.09%, 11.11%,
Average Growth Rate: 10.76%
Forecasted Sales (next 3 months): 2215.2, 2453.47, 2717.69
