Construct a program that tokenizes a sentence into words using regular expressions. Then, count the
number of occurrences of each word and display the results.

SOLUTION:
Tokenize a sentence into words & count occurrences
We can use regular expressions (preg_split) to split a sentence into words, then count using array_count_values().

CODE:
<?php
$sentence = "PHP is great, and PHP is powerful!";

// Step 1: Tokenize into words (ignore punctuation, case-insensitive)
$words = preg_split("/[^a-zA-Z]+/", strtolower($sentence), -1, PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);

// Step 2: Count occurrences
$wordCount = array_count_values($words);

// Step 3: Display results
echo "<h3>Word Frequency Count</h3>";
foreach ($wordCount as $word => $count) {
    echo "$word : $count <br>";
}
?>

OUTPUT:
Word Frequency Count
php : 2
is : 2 
great : 1 
and : 1 
powerful : 1
