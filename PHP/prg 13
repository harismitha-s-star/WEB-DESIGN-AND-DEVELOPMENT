Consider the following snippet, comment your views.
$sub = substr(12345, 2, 2);
echo “sub is $sub”;

ANLAYSIS:
substr(12345, 2, 2)
The substr() function expects a string as the first argument.
12345 is an integer, but PHP will automatically convert it to a string: "12345".
Now, substr("12345", 2, 2):
Starts from index 2 (0-based index: '1' → 0, '2' → 1, '3' → 2)
Takes 2 characters starting from '3'
So the result will be: "34"
echo “sub is $sub”;
The double quotes used here are curly quotes (“ ”) which are not valid in PHP.
PHP expects straight double quotes (" ").
This line will produce a syntax error.

CORRECT CODE:
$sub = substr(12345, 2, 2);
echo "sub is $sub";

OUTPUT:
sub is 34
