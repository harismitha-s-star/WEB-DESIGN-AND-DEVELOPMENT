Discuss the purpose and functionality of PHP sessions and outline their potential application in maintaining a user's shopping cart state across multiple pages


SOLUTION:
Purpose of Sessions:
Sessions allow PHP to store user-specific data across multiple requests/pages.
Unlike cookies (stored on client), sessions are stored on the server and identified by a session ID (usually in a cookie PHPSESSID).
Data is stored in $_SESSION array.

Functionality:
Start session using session_start().
Store values in $_SESSION['key'].
Retrieve them across pages until session is destroyed.
End session with session_destroy().

Example: Shopping Cart with Sessions
(cart.php â€“ show cart):
<?php
session_start();
if (!empty($_SESSION['cart'])) {
    echo "<h2>Your Shopping Cart:</h2>";
    foreach ($_SESSION['cart'] as $item) {
        echo $item . "<br>";
    }
} else {
    echo "Your cart is empty.";
}
?>
