Difference between count() and sizeof() function in PHP.

In PHP, count() and sizeof() are often used to get the number of elements in an array.
Difference between count() and sizeof() in PHP:
Feature	          Count()	                                                            sizeof()
Definition	      Returns the number of elements in an array or something countable.	Alias of count(). Internally, it just calls count().
Return Type	      Integer (number of elements).                                     	Integer (same as count()).
Usage	            Commonly used and preferred.	                                      Exists for historical reasons (for C developers).
Functionality   	Provides additional mode parameter (COUNT_RECURSIVE) 
                   to count recursively.	                                            Same as count(), accepts the same parameter.

Performance      	No difference — both are identical in execution.	                  Same performance as count().


SAMPLE CODE:
<?php
$arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
echo "Using count(): " . count($arr) . "<br>";
echo "Using sizeof(): " . sizeof($arr) . "<br>";
?>

OUTPUT:
Using count(): 5
Using sizeof(): 5

Conclusion:
No practical difference – sizeof() is just an alias of count().
Best practice: use count(), since it’s more widely recognized and clear in meaning.
