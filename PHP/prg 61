Recall the steps to delete an element from an array?

SOLUTION:
To delete an element from an array in PHP,
1. Identify the array
Example:
$arr = array("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date");

2. Find the key/index of the element you want to delete
Suppose we want to delete "banana" which is at index 1.

3. Use unset() to remove the element
unset($arr[1]);
Now the array looks like:
array(0 => "apple", 2 => "cherry", 3 => "date");

4. EXAMPLE CODE:
<?php
$arr = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"];

// Delete element "banana"
unset($arr[1]);

// Reindex array
$arr = array_values($arr);

print_r($arr);
?>

OUTPUT:
Array
(
    [0] => apple
    [1] => cherry
    [2] => date
)
