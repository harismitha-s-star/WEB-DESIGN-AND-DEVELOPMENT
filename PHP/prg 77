Classify the various network functions which provide network information or functions.

SOLUTION:
1. Addressing and Name Resolution Functions
These functions provide information about device names, addresses, and their mappings.
DNS (Domain Name System) – Resolves domain names into IP addresses.
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) – Assigns IP addresses and other network configuration automatically.
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) – Resolves IP addresses to MAC (hardware) addresses.
RARP (Reverse ARP) – Resolves MAC addresses to IP addresses.

2. Routing and Forwarding Functions
These functions provide path selection and movement of data between networks.
Routing Protocols – RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, BGP.
ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) – Provides error reporting and network diagnostics (e.g., ping, traceroute).
IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) – Provides information for managing multicast groups.

3. Management and Monitoring Functions
These functions provide information for controlling and supervising networks.
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) – Provides information about devices and their performance.
Syslog – Provides logging and event reporting.
NetFlow / sFlow – Provide traffic flow information for analysis.

4. Security and Authentication Functions
Provide security-related network information and control.
AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) – Provides user access and tracking information.
RADIUS / TACACS+ – Authentication and authorization services.
Firewalls & IDS/IPS – Provide information about allowed/blocked traffic.

Summary:
Network functions that provide information or services can be classified into:
Addressing & Name Resolution (DNS, DHCP, ARP)
Routing & Forwarding (RIP, OSPF, ICMP)
Management & Monitoring (SNMP, Syslog)
Security & Authentication (AAA, RADIUS, TACACS+)
