Outline the file reading and writing functions of PHP with suitable examples.

SOLUTION:
File Handling in PHP
PHP provides built-in functions for reading and writing files.

Most common functions are:
1. fopen() + fread() + fclose()
fopen("file.txt", "r") → opens file in read mode.
fread($handle, filesize("file.txt")) → reads contents.
fclose($handle) → closes the file.

2. file_get_contents()
Reads the entire file into a string.
Easiest method for small/medium files.

3. file()
Reads file into an array (each line as an element).

File Writing Functions:
1. fopen() + fwrite() + fclose()
Open file in write mode ("w" erases old data, "a" appends).

2. file_put_contents()
Writes data to file in one line.
If file exists, it overwrites unless you use FILE_APPEND.

Summary

fopen()	               Open a file (read/write/append).
fread()	               Read file content.
fwrite()	             Write to a file.
fclose()	             Close the file.
file_get_contents()	   Read whole file into a string.
file_put_contents()	   Write whole string into a file.
file()	               Read file into array (line by line).
