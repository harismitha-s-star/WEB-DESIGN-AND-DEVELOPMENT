Create a PHP program to append two files in another file.

SOLUTION:
How It Works:
file_get_contents() → Reads content of file1.txt and file2.txt.
fopen($destination, "a") → Opens/creates merged.txt in append mode.
fwrite() → Writes contents of both files into the destination.
fclose() → Closes the file safely.

CODE:
<?php
// Define file names
$file1 = "file1.txt";
$file2 = "file2.txt";
$destination = "merged.txt";

// Check if first file exists
if (!file_exists($file1) || !file_exists($file2)) {
    die("One or both source files do not exist.");
}

// Open destination file in append mode (create if not exists)
$destHandle = fopen($destination, "a");

if ($destHandle === false) {
    die("Unable to open destination file.");
}

// Read contents of first file and append
$content1 = file_get_contents($file1);
fwrite($destHandle, $content1 . PHP_EOL);

// Read contents of second file and append
$content2 = file_get_contents($file2);
fwrite($destHandle, $content2 . PHP_EOL);

// Close destination file
fclose($destHandle);

echo "Files '$file1' and '$file2' have been appended into '$destination'.";
?>
