QUESTION 
Interpret the method to pass the information between pages in PHP with an example.

ANSWER:

1. Using GET Method (URL parameters)
Used when: Data is not sensitive and you want to pass it visibly in the URL.
EXAMPLE:
<form action="welcome.php" method="get">
  Name: <input type="text" name="username">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

2. Using POST Method
Used when: Data is sensitive (e.g., login), and should not be exposed in the URL.
EXAMPLE:
<form action="dashboard.php" method="post">
  Username: <input type="text" name="username"><br>
  Password: <input type="password" name="password">
  <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>

3. Using Sessions
Used when: You need to store data across multiple pages (e.g., after login, user remains logged in).
EXAMPLE:
<?php
session_start();
$_SESSION['username'] = "JohnDoe";
header("Location: dashboard.php");
exit;
?>

4. Using Cookies
Used when: You want to store small data on the userâ€™s browser across sessions.
EXAMPLE-1 :
<?php
setcookie("user", "JohnDoe", time() + (86400 * 30)); // 30 days
echo "Cookie set!";
?>
EXAMPLE-2:
<?php
if (isset($_COOKIE['user'])) {
    echo "Welcome back, " . $_COOKIE['user'];
} else {
    echo "No user cookie found.";
}
?>

SUMMARY:
In PHP, data can be passed between pages using GET, POST, SESSION, or COOKIE methods.
GET appends data to the URL, suitable for non-sensitive information.
POST sends data invisibly, commonly used for form submissions.
SESSION stores user data on the server for use across multiple pages.
COOKIE stores data in the user's browser, useful for remembering preferences.
