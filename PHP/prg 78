Elucidate the steps to read and delete existing cookies in the browser.

SOLUTION:
Steps to Read Cookies:
Cookies sent from the browser are available in the $_COOKIE superglobal array.
Use the cookie name as the key to read its value.
Always check with isset() to avoid undefined index errors.

Steps to Delete Cookies:
To delete a cookie, you canâ€™t directly remove it from $_COOKIE.
Instead, you reset it by setting the cookie again with:
The same name
Expiry time in the past (e.g., time() - 3600)
This makes the browser remove it.

CODE:
<?php
// ----------------- READ COOKIE -----------------
if (isset($_COOKIE['user'])) {
    echo "Welcome back, " . $_COOKIE['user'] . "!<br>";
} else {
    echo "No cookie named 'user' found.<br>";
}

// ----------------- DELETE COOKIE -----------------
if (isset($_COOKIE['user'])) {
    // Set cookie expiration to one hour ago
    setcookie("user", "", time() - 3600, "/");
    echo "Cookie 'user' has been deleted.";
}
?>


OUTPUT:
No cookie named 'user' found.
