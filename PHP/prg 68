Construct a PHP script that catches a division by zero error using try-catch.

SOLUTION:
In PHP, division by zero normally throws a warning. 
But from PHP 7+, division by zero in integers throws a DivisionByZeroError, which can be caught using try-catch.

CODE:
<?php
try {
    $a = 10;
    $b = 0;

    if ($b == 0) {
        throw new DivisionByZeroError("Division by zero is not allowed!");
    }

    $result = $a / $b;
    echo "Result: $result";
} 
catch (DivisionByZeroError $e) {
    echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage();
}
?>

OUTPUT:
ERROR!
Error: Division by zero is not allowed!
