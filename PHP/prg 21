Construct a PHP function that checks if a given year is a leap year and returns true or
false accordingly.

CODE:
<?php
function isLeapYear($year) {
    // Leap year rules:
    // 1. Year divisible by 4 is a leap year
    // 2. But years divisible by 100 are NOT leap years
    // 3. Unless they are also divisible by 400
    if (($year % 4 == 0 && $year % 100 != 0) || ($year % 400 == 0)) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}

// Example usage
$year = 2024;
if (isLeapYear($year)) {
    echo "$year is a Leap Year";
} else {
    echo "$year is NOT a Leap Year";
}
?>

OUTPUT:
2024 is a Leap Year

HOW IT WORKS:
Divisible by 4 → candidate for leap year.
Divisible by 100 → normally not a leap year.
Divisible by 400 → still a leap year (century exception).
