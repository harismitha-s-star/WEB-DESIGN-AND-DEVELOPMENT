Examine the various control structures in php and construct a bank transaction problem
with customers deposit and withdrawal of amount.

ANSWER:
Control Structures in PHP

USE: 
"Control structures decide what to execute and how often".

TYPE - STRUCTURE - PURPOSE:
Conditional Statements - if, else, elseif, switch -	Choose actions based on conditions
Looping Statements - for, while, do...while, foreach - Repeat actions
Branching Statements - break, continue, goto - Alter normal flow inside loops
Special Forms - include, require (not strictly control, but affect flow) - Include other files

CODE:
if ($balance > 0) {
    echo "You have money.";
} elseif ($balance == 0) {
    echo "Your balance is empty.";
} else {
    echo "You are in overdraft.";
}

switch ($transactionType) {
    case 'deposit':
        // code
        break;
    case 'withdraw':
        // code
        break;
    default:
        echo "Invalid transaction.";
}

BANK TRNSACTION PROBLEM:

Customer can deposit or withdraw
Validations for insufficient balance
Uses if/else, switch, and loops to process multiple transactions.

CODE:
<?php
// Simple Bank Transaction Simulation

// Customer details
$customerName = "John Doe";
$balance = 1000; // Starting balance

// List of transactions
$transactions = [
    ['type' => 'deposit', 'amount' => 500],
    ['type' => 'withdraw', 'amount' => 200],
    ['type' => 'withdraw', 'amount' => 1500], // should fail (insufficient funds)
    ['type' => 'deposit', 'amount' => 100],
];

// Display initial details
echo "Bank Transactions for $customerName\n";
echo "Starting Balance: Rs.$balance\n\n";

// Loop through each transaction
foreach ($transactions as $txn) {
    $type = strtolower($txn['type']); // normalize to lowercase
    $amount = $txn['amount'];

    switch ($type) {
        case 'deposit':
            $balance += $amount;
            echo "Deposited Rs.$amount | New Balance: Rs.$balance\n";
            break;

        case 'withdraw':
            if ($amount <= $balance) {
                $balance -= $amount;
                echo "Withdrew Rs.$amount | New Balance: Rs.$balance\n";
            } else {
                echo "Withdrawal of Rs.$amount FAILED — Insufficient Balance! Current Balance: Rs.$balance\n";
            }
            break;

        default:
            echo "Invalid transaction type: $type\n";
    }
}

// Final balance
echo "\nFinal Balance: Rs.$balance\n";
?>

OUTPUT:
Bank Transactions for John Doe
Starting Balance: Rs.1000

Deposited Rs.500 | New Balance: Rs.1500
Withdrew Rs.200 | New Balance: Rs.1300
Withdrawal of Rs.1500 FAILED — Insufficient Balance! Current Balance: Rs.1300
Deposited Rs.100 | New Balance: Rs.1400

Final Balance: Rs.1400
