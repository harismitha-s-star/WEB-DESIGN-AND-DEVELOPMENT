Create a PHP script that counts the number of occurrences of a specific word in a given
string.

CODE:
<?php
function countWordOccurrences($string, $word) {
    // Convert both string and word to lowercase for case-insensitive matching
    $string = strtolower($string);
    $word = strtolower($word);

    // Use str_word_count to get an array of words
    $wordsArray = str_word_count($string, 1);

    // Count occurrences
    $count = 0;
    foreach ($wordsArray as $w) {
        if ($w === $word) {
            $count++;
        }
    }

    return $count;
}

// Example usage
$text = "PHP is great. PHP is powerful. I love PHP!";
$searchWord = "PHP";

echo "The word '$searchWord' appears " . countWordOccurrences($text, $searchWord) . " times.";
?>

OUTPUT:
The word 'PHP' appears 3 times.
