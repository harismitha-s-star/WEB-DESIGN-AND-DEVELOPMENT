Build a test cookie with the setcookie( ) function using PHP.

SOLUTION:
Explanation:
setcookie(name, value, expire, path)
name: Name of the cookie → "testCookie".
value: Value stored → "HelloCookie".
expire: Time when cookie expires → time() + 3600 (1 hour from now).
path: / makes the cookie available across the whole website.
On the first page load, PHP sends the cookie to the browser but it isn’t available until the next request.
On refresh, the cookie will be available in the $_COOKIE array.

CODE:
<?php
// Create a cookie named "testCookie" with value "HelloCookie"
setcookie("testCookie", "HelloCookie", time() + 3600, "/"); 
// expires in 1 hour, available across the entire domain

// Check if cookie is set (on page reload)
if (isset($_COOKIE['testCookie'])) {
    echo "Cookie 'testCookie' is set!<br>";
    echo "Value is: " . $_COOKIE['testCookie'];
} else {
    echo "Cookie 'testCookie' is not set yet. Refresh the page to see it.";
}
?>

OUTPUT:
Cookie 'testCookie' is not set yet. Refresh the page to see it.
