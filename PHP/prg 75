Build a PHP function that takes the filename and a new line of content as input. Append the new
line of content as a new line at the end of the file.

SOLUTION:
PHP function that takes a filename and a string, then appends it as a new line at the end of the file.

CODE:
<?php
function appendLineToFile($filename, $newLine) {
    // Ensure new line ends with a newline character
    $line = $newLine . PHP_EOL;

    // Use FILE_APPEND to add content instead of overwriting
    if (file_put_contents($filename, $line, FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX)) {
        echo "Line successfully appended to $filename";
    } else {
        echo "Error: Could not write to file.";
    }
}

// Example usage
$filename = "example.txt";
$newContent = "This is a new appended line.";

appendLineToFile($filename, $newContent);
?>
