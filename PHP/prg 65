Demonstrate PHP script that checks if a string contains another string and displays the result.

CODE:
<?php
$mainString = "Welcome to PHP programming!";
$searchString = "PHP";

if (strpos($mainString, $searchString) !== false) {
    echo "The string '$searchString' was found in the main string.";
} else {
    echo "The string '$searchString' was NOT found in the main string.";
}
?>

OUTPUT:
The string 'PHP' was found in the main string.
