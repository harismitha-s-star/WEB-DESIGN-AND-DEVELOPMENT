How can you use regular expressions to extract all email addresses from a given string using an array in
PHP?

CODE:
<?php
// Sample string containing email addresses
$text = "You can contact us at admin@example.com, support@domain.org or sales@shop.net.";

// Regular expression for email addresses
$pattern = "/[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,}/";

// Extract all matches into an array
preg_match_all($pattern, $text, $matches);

// $matches[0] contains all emails
$emails = $matches[0];

// Display result
echo "Extracted Email Addresses:<br>";
print_r($emails);
?>

OUTPUT:
Extracted Email Addresses:
Array
(
    [0] => admin@example.com
    [1] => support@domain.org
    [2] => sales@shop.net
)
