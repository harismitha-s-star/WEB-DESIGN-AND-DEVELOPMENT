Prioritize the use of GET and POST arguments in PHP with a real time example.

ANSWER:
In PHP, GET and POST are two primary methods for sending data from a client (browser) to a server, but they are prioritized 
differently depending on the use case.

POST → Preferred for sensitive or large amounts of data (login forms, file uploads, payments).
GET → Preferred for retrieving or bookmarking data without sensitive information (search queries, filters).

POST METHOD CODE:
<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    $name = $_POST['name']; // safer for sensitive data
    $message = $_POST['message'];

    echo "Hello, $name! Your message has been received: $message";
}
?>

<form method="POST">
    Name: <input type="text" name="name"><br>
    Message: <textarea name="message"></textarea><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>

ADVANTAGES OF POST:
Data is not visible in the URL.
Can handle large input.
More secure for private data.

GET METHOD CODE:
<?php
if (isset($_GET['search'])) {
    $term = $_GET['search'];
    echo "Searching for: $term";
}
?>
<form method="GET">
    Search: <input type="text" name="search">
    <input type="submit" value="Go">
</form>

ADVANTAGES OF GET:
The search query appears in the URL (e.g., ?search=PHP), so users can bookmark or share it.
No sensitive information is sent.
