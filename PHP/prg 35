Write a PHP script using an array that checks if a string contains another string and displays the result.

CODE:
<?php
// Array of main strings
$texts = array(
    "PHP is a server-side scripting language.",
    "I enjoy learning programming.",
    "Regular expressions are powerful in PHP."
);

// Word to search
$search = "PHP";

// Loop through each string and check
foreach ($texts as $sentence) {
    if (strpos($sentence, $search) !== false) {
        echo "The string contains '$search': $sentence <br>";
    } else {
        echo "The string does not contain '$search': $sentence <br>";
    }
}
?>

OUTPUT:
The string contains 'PHP': PHP is a server-side scripting language.
The string does not contain 'PHP': I enjoy learning programming. 
The string contains 'PHP': Regular expressions are powerful in PHP.
