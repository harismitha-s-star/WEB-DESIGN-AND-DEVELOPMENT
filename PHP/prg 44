Develop a music playlist management system for a streaming service. The system should allow users to
create, modify, and organize playlists. How would you use arrays and array functions to store and
manipulate the song data and playlist information efficiently?

CODE:
<?php
// Step 1: Master song library
$songs = array(
    1 => array("title" => "Shape of You", "artist" => "Ed Sheeran", "duration" => "3:53"),
    2 => array("title" => "Blinding Lights", "artist" => "The Weeknd", "duration" => "4:02"),
    3 => array("title" => "Levitating", "artist" => "Dua Lipa", "duration" => "3:24"),
    4 => array("title" => "Believer", "artist" => "Imagine Dragons", "duration" => "3:37")
);

// Step 2: Create playlists (store song IDs)
$playlists = array(
    "Workout" => array(1, 4),
    "Chill"   => array(2, 3)
);

// Function to display a playlist
function showPlaylist($name, $playlist, $songs) {
    echo "<b>Playlist: $name</b><br>";
    foreach ($playlist as $songId) {
        echo "- " . $songs[$songId]["title"] . " by " . $songs[$songId]["artist"] . "<br>";
    }
    echo "<br>";
}

// Step 3: Add a song to playlist
array_push($playlists["Workout"], 2);

// Step 4: Remove a song (e.g., remove "Levitating" from Chill)
if(($key = array_search(3, $playlists["Chill"])) !== false) {
    unset($playlists["Chill"][$key]);
}

// Step 5: Shuffle Workout playlist
shuffle($playlists["Workout"]);

// Step 6: Display Playlists
showPlaylist("Workout", $playlists["Workout"], $songs);
showPlaylist("Chill", $playlists["Chill"], $songs);
?>

OUTPUT:
Playlist: Workout
- Blinding Lights by The Weeknd
- Shape of You by Ed Sheeran
- Believer by Imagine Dragons
Playlist: Chill
- Blinding Lights by The Weeknd
