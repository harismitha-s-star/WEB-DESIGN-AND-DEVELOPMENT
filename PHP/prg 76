Write a simple 'birthday countdown' script, the script will count the number of days between
current day and birthday.

CODE:
<?php
// Set your birthday (month and day, year will adjust automatically)
$birthday = "12-25"; // Example: Dec 25

// Current date
$today = new DateTime();

// Get this year's birthday
$currentYear = $today->format("Y");
$birthdayDate = DateTime::createFromFormat("m-d-Y", $birthday . "-" . $currentYear);

// If birthday already passed this year, set for next year
if ($birthdayDate < $today) {
    $birthdayDate->modify("+1 year");
}

// Calculate difference
$interval = $today->diff($birthdayDate);

// Display countdown
echo "Your next birthday is on: " . $birthdayDate->format("d M Y") . "<br>";
echo "Days left until birthday: " . $interval->days;
?>

OUTPUT:
Your next birthday is on: 25 Dec 2025
Days left until birthday: 129
